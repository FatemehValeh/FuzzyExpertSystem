# FuzzyExpertSystem
This is the fuzzy expert system project for the Computational Intelligence course at The Amirkabir University of Technology. Like any other FES, this project also includes three main steps. The first step, a.k.a. fuzzification, is the conversion of crisp sets to a fuzzy set.
The second step, a.k.a. inference is where we interpret the values in the input vector and, based on some sets of rules, assign values to the output vector.
In the third and final step, a.k.a. defuzzification, a single number is obtained as the output of the aggregated fuzzy set.

The full description of the project in Persian is available in the [description file](https://github.com/FatemehValeh/FuzzyExpertSystem/blob/main/description.pdf).
