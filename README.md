# FuzzyExpertSystem
This is the fuzzy expert system project for the Computational Intelligence coures. It has three steps. First, fuzzification, the conversion of crisp sets to a fuzzy set.
The second step is inference where we interprets the values in the input vector and, based on some sets of rules, assigns values to the output vector.
In the last step which is defuzzification, a single number is obtained from the output of the aggregated fuzzy set. The full description of the project in Persian is available in the
